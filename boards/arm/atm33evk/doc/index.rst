Getting Started
***************

Follow the instructions_ from the official Zephyr documentation on how to get started.

.. _instructions: https://docs.zephyrproject.org/3.4.0/develop/getting_started/index.html

Connecting an ATMEVK on Windows
===============================

The J-Link OB device driver must be replaced with WinUSB in order for it to
become available as a USB device and usable by OpenOCD.
This can be done using Zadig.

Windows Administrator privileges are required for replacing a driver.

Zadig can be obtained from:

https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi/releases

At the time of this writing, the latest version -- 2.4 -- can be
obtained using the following direct link.

https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi/releases/download/b721/zadig-2.4.exe

To replace the driver:

#. From the "Options" menu of Zadig, click "List all devices".
#. From the drop-down menu, find "BULK interface" corresponding to
   the Atmosic board.  It should show "jlink (v...)" as
   the current driver on the left.
#. Select "WinUSB (v...)" as the replacement on the right.
#. Click "Replace Driver"

Verify the successful installation of WinUSB by going to the Windows
Device Manager and confirming that the "BULK interface" shows
as such rather than "J-Link driver".  (In Device Manager, expand category
"Universal Serial Bus devices" and look for "BULK interface".)


Programming and Debugging
*************************

Applications for the ATMEVK-33xx-xx-5 and ATMEVK-33xxe-xx-5 boards can be built, flashed, and debugged with familiar `west build` and `west flash`.

The atm33evk boards require at least two images to be built -- the SPE and the application.

The Atmosic SPE lives in the HAL module at ``${WEST_TOPDIR}/modules/hal/atmosic/ATM33xx-5/examples/spe``.

.. _var_assignments:

In the remainder of this document, use the following variable assignments/substitutions::

 SPE=modules/hal/atmosic/ATM33xx-5/examples/spe
 APP=zephyr/samples/hello_world
 MCUBOOT=bootloader/mcuboot/boot/zephyr

and::

 BOARD=ATMEVK-3330-QN-5

Alternatively, use any board from the boards_ list as ``$BOARD``.

Building the SPE
================

Non-MCUboot Option
------------------

If device firmware update (DFU) is not needed, the following simple option can be used::

  west build -s $SPE -b $BOARD -d build/$BOARD/$SPE


MCUboot Option
--------------

To build with MCUboot because, for example, DFU is needed, first build MCUboot::

  west build -s $MCUBOOT -b $BOARD@mcuboot -d build/$BOARD/$MCUBOOT -- -DCONFIG_BOOT_SIGNATURE_TYPE_ECDSA_P256=y -DCONFIG_DEBUG=n -DCONFIG_BOOT_MAX_IMG_SECTORS=512 -DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE="$WEST_TOPDIR/zephyr/boards/arm/atm33evk/${BOARD}_mcuboot_bl.overlay"

and then the Atmosic SPE::

  west build -s $SPE -b $BOARD@mcuboot -d build/$BOARD/$SPE -- -DCONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT=y -DCONFIG_MCUBOOT_GENERATE_UNSIGNED_IMAGE=n -DDTS_EXTRA_CPPFLAGS=";"

Note that make use of "board revision" to configure our board paritions to work for MCUboot.  On top of the "revisions," MCUboot currently needs an additional overlay that must be provided via the command line to give it the entire SRAM.


Building the Application
========================

Note: ``${BOARD}_ns`` is the non-secure variant of ``$BOARD``.


BLE Link Controller Options
---------------------------
When building a Bluetooth application (``CONFIG_BT``) the BLE driver component provides two link controller options. A fixed BLE link controller image and a statically linked BLE link controller library.  The BLE link controller sits at the lowest layer of the Zephyr Bluetooth protocol stack.  Zephyr provides the upper Bluetooth Host stack that can interface with BLE link controllers that conform to the standard Bluetooth Host Controller Interface specification.

To review how the fixed and statically linked controllers are used, please refer to the README.rst in modules/hal/atmosic/ATM33xx-5/drivers/ble/.


Non-MCUboot Option
------------------

Build the app with the non-secure board variant and the SPE (see Non-MCUboot Option build above) configured as follows::

  west build -s $APP -b ${BOARD}_ns -d build/${BOARD}_ns/$APP -- -DCONFIG_SPE_PATH=\"${WEST_TOPDIR}/build/$BOARD/$SPE\"

Passing the path to the SPE is for linking in the non-secure-callable veneer file generated in building the SPE.

With this approach, each built image has to be flashed separately.  Optionally, build a single merged image by enabling ``CONFIG_MERGE_SPE_NSPE``, thereby minimizing the flashing steps::

  west build -s $APP -b ${BOARD}_ns -d build/${BOARD}_ns/$APP -- -DCONFIG_SPE_PATH=\"${WEST_TOPDIR}/build/$BOARD/$SPE\" -DCONFIG_MERGE_SPE_NSPE=y


MCUboot Option
--------------

Build the application with MCUboot and SPE as follows::

  west build -s $APP -b ${BOARD}_ns@mcuboot -d build/${BOARD}_ns/$APP -- -DCONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT=y -DCONFIG_MCUBOOT_SIGNATURE_KEY_FILE=\"bootloader/mcuboot/root-ec-p256.pem\" -DDTS_EXTRA_CPPFLAGS=";" -DCONFIG_SPE_PATH=\"${WEST_TOPDIR}/build/$BOARD/$SPE\"

This is somewhat of a non-standard workflow.  When passing ``-DCONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT=y`` on the application build command line, ``west`` automatically creates a singed, merged image (``zephyr.signed.{bin,hex}``), which is ultimately used by ``west flash`` to program the device.  The original application binaries are renamed with a ``.nspe`` suffixed to the file basename (``zephyr.{bin,hex,elf}`` renamed to ``zephyr.nspe.{bin,hex,elf}``) and are the ones that should be supplied to a debugger.

.. _flashing:

Flashing
========

``west flash`` is used to program a device with the necessary images, often only built as described above and sometimes also with a pre-built library provided as an ELF binary.

In this section, substitute ``$DEVICE_ID`` with the serial for the Atmosic interface board used.  For an atmevk33 board, this is typically a J-Link serial, but it can also be an FTDI serial of the form ``ATRDIXXXX``.

The following subsections describe how to flash a device with and without MCUboot option.  If the application requires Bluetooth (configured with ``CONFIG_BT``), and uses the fixed BLE link controller image option, then the controller image requires programming.  This is typically done prior to programming the application and resetting (omitting the ``--noreset`` option to ``west flash``).  For example::

  west flash --verify --device=$DEVICE_ID --skip-rebuild -d build/$BOARD/$MCUBOOT --use-elf --elf-file modules/hal/atmosic/ATM33xx-5/drivers/ble/atmwstk_LL.elf --noreset

For the non-MCUboot option, substitute ``$MCUBOOT`` with ``$SPE`` in the above command.


Non-MCUboot Option
------------------

Flash the SPE and the application separately if ``CONFIG_MERGE_SPE_NSPE`` was not enabled::

  west flash --device=$DEVICE_ID --verify -d build/$BOARD/$SPE --noreset
  west flash --device=$DEVICE_ID --verify -d build/${BOARD}_ns/$APP

Alternatively, if ``CONFIG_MERGE_SPE_NSPE`` was enabled in building the application, the first step (programming the SPE) can be skipped.


MCUboot Option
--------------

First, flash MCUboot::

   west flash --verify --device=$DEVICE_ID -d build/$BOARD/bootloader/mcuboot/boot/zephyr --erase_flash --noreset

Then flash the singed application image (merged with SPE)::

   west flash --verify --device=$DEVICE_ID -d build/${BOARD}_ns/$APP


Support Script
==============

A convenient support script is provided in the Zephyr repository and can be used as follows.  From the ``west topdir`` directory where Zephyr was cloned and ``west`` was initialized, run the following:

Without MCUBoot::

  zephyr/boards/arm/atm33evk/support/run.sh -n -e -d [-w <flavor>] [-l <flavor>] -a <application path> -j -s <DEVICE_ID> <BOARD>

With MCUBoot::

  zephyr/boards/arm/atm33evk/support/run.sh -e -d [-w <flavor>] [-l <flavor>] -a <application path> -j -s <DEVICE_ID> <BOARD>

* replace ``<DEVICE_ID>`` with the appropriate device ID (typically the JLINK serial ID. Ex: ``000900028906``)
* replace ``<BOARD>`` with the targeted board design (Ex: ATMEVK-3325-LQK )
* replace ``<application path>`` with the path to your application (Ex: ``zephyr/samples/bluetooth/peripheral_dis``)
* see below for selecting ``-w``/``-l`` options.

Using -w [flavor] and -l [flavor] Options
-----------------------------------------

The ``-w`` option selects the use of the fixed BLE controller stack image.  The flavor parameter can be ``LL`` or ``PD50LL``. The ``-l`` option selects for the statically linked BLE controller library.  The flavor can be PD50.  The ``-l`` flag is mutually exclusive with the ``-w`` option.  When using the ``-l`` option the build will recover memory resources reserved for the fixed image BLE controller and provide them to the NSPE image.  The ``-w`` option should not be used to flash the ATMWSTK when the application has already been built and installed using the ``-l`` option.  Flashing the fixed BLE controller on top of an existing install that uses the static library may corrupt the installed image.

Using the Support Script on Windows
-----------------------------------

This script is written in Bash.  While Bash is readily available on most Linux distributions and macOS, it is not so on Windows.  However, Bash is bundled with Git.  The following single command demonstrates how to build, flash, and run the ``hello_world`` application using Bash in a typical installation of Git executed from the root of the Zephyr workspace::

  C:\zephyrproject>"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" zephyr\boards\arm\atm33evk\support\run.sh -e -d -a zephyr\samples\hello_world -j -s <DEVICE_ID> <BOARD>

As an alternative, pass ``-n`` to build without MCUboot.

From this point on out, unless the bootloader has been modified, the source code for the application (in this case ``zephyr\samples\hello_world``) can be modified and then programmed with ``-d`` and ``-e`` omitted::

  C:\zephyrproject>"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" zephyr\boards\arm\atm33evk\support\run.sh -a zephyr\samples\hello_world -j -s <DEVICE_ID> <BOARD>

Viewing the Console Output
**************************

Linux and macOS
===============

For a Linux host, monitor the console output with a favorite terminal
program, such as::

  screen /dev/ttyACM1 115200

On macOS, the serial console will be on USB port (``/dev/tty.usbmodem<12-digit devide ID>[13]``).  Use the following command to find the port for serial console::

  $ ls /dev/tty.usbmodem*
  /dev/tty.usbmodem<DEVICE_ID>1
  /dev/tty.usbmodem<DEVICE_ID>3
  $


Windows
=======

Console output for current Atmosic ATM3330 goes to the JLink CDC UART
serial port.  That is Interface 2 of J-Link OB USB on the Atmosic
board.  In order to view the console output, use a serial terminal
program such as PuTTY (available from
https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty) to connect to
JLink CDC UART port generated by the interface 2 of J-Link OB USB
with the baud rate set to 115200.

If using PuTTY, open a session with the following three parameters:

#. Serial line: <COM port> (see next paragraph)
#. Speed: 115200
#. Connection type: Serial

A common way to determine <COM port> for parameter #1 above is to use
the Windows Device Manager as follows.

#. Under the "View" menu, choose "Devices by container"
#. Under the container "J-Link", find "JLink CDC UART Port (COM<N>)", where <N> is some COM port sequence number

Then use "COM<N>" for the serial line parameter in PuTTY.


Zephyr DFU
==========

The steps for building and flashing will mostly remain the same as documented in the above sections.
Any differences will be noted here.

For this section, use the following updated variable assignments/substitutions along with the ones provided `above`__::

  APP=zephyr/samples/subsys/mgmt/mcumgr/smp_svr

__ var_assignments_

In Zephyr, DFU is possible using the ``mcumgr`` subsystem. This makes use of some of the features from MCUBoot in order to facilitate image uploading and swapping.
In order to test this subsystem, Zephyr provides an SMP server sample that makes use of the subsystem to test performing Serial DFU and BLE OTA firmware updates.
To actually perform the DFU, the ``mcumgr`` program can be used. Currently, this supports UART on all platforms and BLE on macOS and Linux (only Linux is tested currently for BLE).
More information about the smp_svr sample and how to use the mcumgr utility can be found `here. <https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/samples/subsys/mgmt/mcumgr/smp_svr/README.html>`_

A new overlay file has been provided named ``overlay-disable-stats.conf`` that saves around 3 kB by disabling ``taskstat`` and the stats subsystems if those features are not needed.

To flash smp_svr follow the MCUBoot instructions from flashing_.
When using BLE remember that the wireless stack must also be flashed.

.. _serial_dfu:

Building for Serial (UART)
--------------------------

On Atmosic EVKs, only UART0 can be used to perform DFU, as UART1 RX is not connected by default.
However, UART1 should be usable on a custom board design if it is connected.
Special care will need to be made for BENIGN_BOOT if the default pins are used.

By default the UART0 peripheral is not enabled, which will cause a build error.
In order to enable UART0, please modify the boards DTS file and add ``status = "okay";`` to the ``&uart0`` block.

When building smp_svr to support DFU over serial, the only change from a standard MCUBoot build is to make sure that the proper overlay configurations are applied ``-DOVERLAY_CONFIG="overlay-serial.conf;overlay-fs.conf;overlay-shell-mgmt.conf"``::

  west build -p -s ${APP} -b ${BOARD}_ns@mcuboot -d build/${BOARD}_ns/${APP} -- -DCONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT=y -DCONFIG_MCUBOOT_SIGNATURE_KEY_FILE=\"bootloader/mcuboot/root-ec-p256.pem\" -DCONFIG_SPE_PATH=\"${WEST_TOPDIR}/build/${BOARD}/${SPE}\" -DDTS_EXTRA_CPPFLAGS=";" -DOVERLAY_CONFIG="overlay-serial.conf;overlay-fs.conf;overlay-shell-mgmt.conf"

Building for BLE
----------------

If building smp_svr using RRAM only, then the ``PD50LL`` wireless stack **must** be used. This can be done by using the following variable assignments/substitutions::

  ATMWSTK=PD50LL

If building smp_svr using external flash, either the ``PD50LL`` or the ``LL`` wireless stack can be used. When using the ``LL`` wireless stack, the following variable assignments/substitutions should be used::

  ATMWSTK=LL

When building smp_svr to support DFU over BLE, all images (MCUBoot, SPE, smp_svr) need to be built with ``-DDTS_EXTRA_CPPFLAGS="-DATMWSTK=${ATMWSTK};"`` (when using external flash, the ``-DDFU_IN_FLASH;`` option must also be present).
smp_svr additionally needs to be configured to use the ATMWSTK using ``-DCONFIG_USE_ATMWSTK=y -DCONFIG_ATMWSTK=\"${ATMWSTK}\" -DCONFIG_ATM_SLEEP_ADJ=17`` and use the proper overlay configuration files ``-DEXTRA_CONF_FILE="overlay-bt.conf"`` (If Serial DFU support is also desired, then the overlay files from the serial_dfu_ section)::

  west build -p -s ${MCUBOOT} -b ${BOARD}@mcuboot -d build/${BOARD}/${MCUBOOT} -- -DCONFIG_BOOT_SIGNATURE_TYPE_ECDSA_P256=y -DCONFIG_BOOT_MAX_IMG_SECTORS=512 -DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE="${WEST_TOPDIR}/zephyr/boards/arm/atm33evk/${BOARD}_mcuboot_bl.overlay" -DDTS_EXTRA_CPPFLAGS="-DATMWSTK=${ATMWSTK};"
  west build -p -s ${SPE} -b ${BOARD}@mcuboot -d build/${BOARD}/${SPE} -- -DCONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT=y -DCONFIG_MCUBOOT_GENERATE_UNSIGNED_IMAGE=n -DDTS_EXTRA_CPPFLAGS="-DATMWSTK=${ATMWSTK};"
  west build -p -s ${APP} -b ${BOARD}_ns@mcuboot -d build/${BOARD}_ns/${APP} -- -DCONFIG_BOOTLOADER_MCUBOOT=y -DCONFIG_MCUBOOT_SIGNATURE_KEY_FILE=\"bootloader/mcuboot/root-ec-p256.pem\" -DCONFIG_SPE_PATH=\"${WEST_TOPDIR}/build/${BOARD}/${SPE}\" -DDTS_EXTRA_CPPFLAGS="-DATMWSTK=${ATMWSTK};" -DCONFIG_USE_ATMWSTK=y -DCONFIG_ATMWSTK=\"${ATMWSTK}\" -DEXTRA_CONF_FILE="overlay-bt.conf" -DCONFIG_ATM_SLEEP_ADJ=17
